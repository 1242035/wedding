              beautiful cities as she could. Thanks to her beloved sister Wendy it was possible to jump from the neon nights of Miami, through
              the diverse city of London, to then learn the leisurely ways of Italy. While Jocelyn was exploring and realizing her passion in
              life, she realized she needed to find her way back to the city she knew her dream job was waiting for her in fashion.

              the universe, New York.

      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <p>
        Being children of the modern day and age, our story began with venturing onto OK Cupid. As hesitant as one of us was to engage
        herself with a complete stranger online (while the other happily explored with enthusiasm) on our first date it soon became
        apparent that we met the natural occurrences when 2 people meet and all feelings of the unknown disappeared because at that moment
        right in front of me I was meeting my best friend. As the cliche tale goes, the rest is history.

      <h2>GETTING TO CROATIA</h2>
      <p>Being a popular summer tourist destination, getting to Croatia is relatively easy. The closest major city to Hvar is&nbsp;
         <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/a8JeWAEuugN2">Split</a> and it is fairly well connected by pretty much all European airlines
         and some low-cost carriers, such as&nbsp;
         <a href="https://wizzair.com/#/booking/select-flight/LTN/SPU/2017-08-22/2017-09-02/1/0/0">WizzAir</a> and&nbsp;
         <a href="https://www.eurowings.com/en.html">Eurowings</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The second closest major airport is in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/goc5oZWa3wC2">Dubrovnik</a>. It is about 5 hours away
         from Hvar via a ferry, which is kind of far, but if you are planning on doing some touring before or after the wedding it is
         a great location to visit. Have a look at the 'Things to do section' further down for more information on that.
      </p>
      <p>As of the time of writing there are no&nbsp;
         <a href="https://www.kayak.com/flights/NYC-SPU/2017-08-25/2017-09-02/2adults">direct flights</a>&nbsp;
         from the US or Canada to Croatia, so guests coming from there will have to do at least one connection in a major European hub
         such as Frankfurt, Zurich or Amsterdam.
      </p>

      <h2>FERRY TO THE ISLAND OF HVAR</h2>
      <p>The Split airport is located about 25km (16mi) from the seaport from where the ferries leave for Hvar. According to the bus
         company's <a href="http://www.buscroatia.com/airport-split/">website</a> a taxi should cost about 35 EUR/40 USD for 1-3 people and
         a bus should be around 4 EUR/5 USD per person.
      </p>

      <div id="gmap">
        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1QdPbr1DgM7Cgiw2PwAbLgpINiSI"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>Once you are at the seaport and looking for transportation to the island, please note that there are two landing spots on the
         island - Hvar Town and the Old Town (Stari Grad). The wedding will be in Hvar Town, which is in the south-west end of the island,
         not in the Old Town, which is on the nortern end. Please make sure you are boarding the right ferry, but even if you make a
         mistake, stay calm because there is a bus between the two.
      </p>

      <div id="gmap">

      </div>

      <h3><a href="http://www.jadrolinija.hr/en/ferry-croatia">Jadrolinija</a></h3>
      <p>This is a high-speed catamaran service from Split to Hvar Town which takes about 65 min. This is the fastest option and costs
         around 10 EUR/11 USD per person. If you have a car, this site also contains the schedule and pricing for the ferries, which
         transport cars to the island.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3><a href="http://www.krilo.hr/en/index.html">Kapetan Luka</a></h3>
      <p>This is the regular ferry service which takes about 2.5 hours and should cost around 5-10 EUR/6-11 USD per person.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3><a href="https://www.atlantis-marine.net/en/croatia-boat-transfers">Chartered Speed Boat</a></h3>
      <p>If you are coming as a group, this site has information for inclusive transportation packages with pickup from the airport. The
         sailing part of the journey takes between 45 min to 1 hour, which is similar to the catamaran service, but is a little bit more
         convenient because it also includes a pickup from the airport. If you choose this option, there is a 5% discount
         using <SecretTooltip fnTooltip={() => { return 'adriaticweddings'; }}>this code</SecretTooltip> (please click on the 'this' in
         order to display the code).
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>DRIVING</h2>
      <p>For those renting a car or driving to Croatia, we don't yet know what are the driving or parking conditions on the island. From
         reading various tour guides and traveller comments it appears that there are drivable roads and paid parking spots so it should
         not be a problem. However we will update this section more as we go on our exploratory trip in the spring.
      </p>
      <p>
         Please not that unless you are coming by car to the island of Hvar, there should not be a need for you to rent one unless you want
         to explore the island. There are many organized boat tripts to discover the surrounding Dalmatian islands.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>ACCOMMODATIONS</h2>
      <p>Once on the island in Hvar Town there are various accommodation options ranging from fancy hotels to renting an apartment
         on <a href="https://goo.gl/uHTDYn">AirBnB</a>. The wedding will be in the Amfora Resort so any accommodation within walking
         distance from there should be fine.
      </p>
      <p>For guests wishing to stay in a hotel, the <a href="http://www.suncanihvar.com/">Suncani Hvar</a> chain of hotels offers a 20%
         discount using <SecretTooltip fnTooltip={() => { return 'WEDDKALOIANJOCELYN'; }}>this code</SecretTooltip> (please click on the
         'this' in order to show it or call us if it doesn't work). The code must be entered in the <i>"Corporate/Promo Code ?"</i> section
         for the discounted prices to apply and is valid for staying 5 days prior and 5 days after the wedding day. Please note that hotels
         can be somewhat pricey, so it is definitely worth researching the available AirBnB apartments.

      <p>Since all of you are coming from different parts of the world, we presume that you would like to make a full vacation out of your
         trip to Croatia. In this section we are listing some of the main tourist places to visit and have suggestions for routes to take.

        <img className="large-image" src="img/dubrovnik.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik old city" />
      </p>
      <p>Located in the very south of the country, Dubrovnik was once called the "Pearl of the Adriatic" for its architecture and importance
         in trade. We won't pretend that we know much about its history, but it is a place which must be visited and is also a convenient
         location to fly into and work your way up the coast to Hvar. On top of that, for the 'Game of Thrones' fans, quite a few scenes from
         this show were filmed in Dubrovnik. See&nbsp;
         <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/game-of-thrones-filming-locations-guide/">this article</a> for more
         information.

      <p>
        <img className="large-image" src="img/plitvice-lakes.jpg" alt="Plitvice lakes" />
      </p>
      <p>This is a beautiful national park covered with heavy forests and waterfalls. It is in the northern half of the country and is about 2 hours
         drive from Zagreb, the capital of Croatia and 4-5 hours from Split. If you find good flights to Zagreb, Plitvice Lakes can serve as a good
         midway destination to visit while making you way to the south of the country.

        <img className="large-image" src="img/mljet.jpg" alt="Mljet" />
      </p>
      <p>The Dalmatian islands (one of which is Hvar) offer amazing scenery, nice beaches and sailing opportunities. Island hopping, swimming and
         sunbathing is great way to spend a few days or even a week. Of these islands, Hvar is deemed as the 'party island' while&nbsp;
         <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/dalmatia/mljet-island">Mljet</a> is the most scenic and tranquil. It is located between Hvar
         and Dubrovnik.
